######## Summarizing Data Using the GROUPING sets Operator  ########
## you summarize data by using the GROUP BY clause within an
# aggregate query. 
##This clause creates groupings which are defined by a set of expressions.

####One row per unique combination of the expressions in the GROUP BY clause is returned,
##and aggregate functions such as COUNT or SUM may be used on any columns in the query

### SYNTAX FOR GROUPING ##
#  SELECT   column1, column2, column3, .. 
#  FROM     table_name
#  GROUP BY column1, column2, column3,â€¦

##### OR ####
# SELECT column_name(s)
# FROM table_name
# WHERE condition
# GROUP BY column_name(s)
# ORDER BY column_name(s);

### ORDER BY -- sort the result in either ASCENDING ORDER (ASC) OR DESCENDING ORDER (DESC).
##controls the presentation of the columns
### GROUP BY -- Its groups rows that have the same values. It is often use with aggregate functions 
##e.g count(), max(), min(), sum(), avg(). groupby control the presentation of the rows
## The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like 
## "find the number of customers in each country".

############# SQL JOIN ################
/* 
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables,
based on a related column between them.

Different Types of SQL JOINs
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
